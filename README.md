A cross-course school project for an ecommerce website selling rain jackets.

## Description

This project was my cross-course project at Noroff. The project started during the Design course, where we began with Figma, and it progressed through subsequent courses like HTML and CSS. Later on, JavaScript was introduced, and WordPress with WooCommerce was integrated as a headless CMS.

The brief was to create an ecommerce site for a fictive company called Rainy Days. An online shop selling men's and womenâ€™s rain jackets.

**The site contains the following pages:**

- Home
- Products
- Product Specific
- Checkout
- Checkout Success
- About
- Contact
