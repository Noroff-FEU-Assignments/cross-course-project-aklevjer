    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      I would start by informing the client about the most common web security threats, such as Cross-site scripting, SQL injection, and Cross-site request forgery.<br />
      I would also explain how these attacks work and the potential impact they could have on their website.<br /><br />

      Next, I would advise the client to implement Two-Step Verification, strong password requirements, and automatic user timeouts to keep their website safe from attacks.<br />
      I would also recommend choosing a secure web hosting provider that offers regular security updates, firewalls, and malware scanning.<br /><br />

      Additionally, I would also advise the client to ensure that any information entered into the website is in the correct format.<br />
      They can use special tools, such as those that sanitize data and code, to remove any harmful code from the data entered by users.<br /><br />
      Finally, I would suggest implementing Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration (CI/CD), which is an automatic process that integrates and delivers code to production.<br />

      This process runs every change against some security checks before deciding whether to deliver the change to production, decreasing the chances of any security problems when developing the website.
